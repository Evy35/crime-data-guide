## Introduction
  Welcome to the UK crime Data Analysis repository,This projectn aims to provide insights into crime trends across different regions in the Unini Kingdom.The data used here is sourced from(htt://www.ons.gov.uk)coveringa range of crime categories and geographical locations. With the high rate of crime rate in the society,it seems nowhere is safe for anyone,To curb the effect of the high rate of crime in the society, the security agencies will the need modern technologies and data analysis to tackle it effectively.This project is in collaboration with Datafied Academy(www.datafied.tech). 

## problem Statement
Police department in a big city is overwhelm with the high rate of crime rates and looking for proactive crime preventive measures and seek for the help of experistto help them reduce the crime rate.The data given talked about the geographical location with the high rate of crime,type of crimes, year with the highest grime rate e.t.c.

Data Moldeling
A dimensional data model was chosen for this which to break down the anaylsis were identified.New tables for identified dimensions were created.The table is includes
* offence Dim
* data Dim
* location Dim
* crimeData fact
  Crime data modelling involves using statistical and computational methods to analyze and predict patterns in crime data,
  Here are steps and techniques involved:
  1. Data Collection
  2. Data  processsing
  3. Explortory Data Analysis
